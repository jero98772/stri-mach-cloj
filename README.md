# **Stri_Mach_Cloj**

This is my first project in Clojure! I'm learning Clojure and improving my knowledge of data structures and algorithms by implementing string-matching algorithms. This project implements the following algorithms:

- **Rabin-Karp**
- **Boyer-Moore**
- **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)**

## **Installation**

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jero98772/stri-mach-cloj
```

## **Usage**

Start the server with Leiningen:

```bash
lein ring server
```

## **Examples**

Below is an example screenshot of the project in action:

## **Goals**

This project was created as a hands-on way to:
- Learn Clojure through practical coding.
- Deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.
- Gain experience with string-matching techniques.

## **Contributing**

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve the project or add new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
